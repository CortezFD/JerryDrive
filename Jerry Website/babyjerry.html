    <h2>Baby Jerry</h2>
    <p>Like us Jerry has a fair share of embarrasing baby pictures. Here are some delightful images of Baby Jerry:</p>

        <figcaption>This was taken the day my brother found Jerry. If memory serves me right, this was taken after his shower. He was filled with fleas and other nasties. Nowadays, he spends his time cleaner, he’s a professional at grooming his fur.</figcaption>

        <img src="Images/Baby Jerry/spookedbabyjerry.png" alt="Spooked Baby Jerry">
        <figcaption>This was taken a few weeks after rescuing Jerry. He acclimated really quickly here and became a part of the family.</figcaption>

        <img src="Images/Baby Jerry/babyjerrysleep.png" alt="Sleepy Jerry">
        <figcaption>Jerry seemed to have hit it off with my preexisting cat, Simba. They sometimes sleep together, as they like to fight for the bed.</figcaption>
